"""Frame <-> telemetry time-sync alignment by timestamp (Task 1.5).

Each `Frame` is paired with a `Pose` interpolated at the frame's timestamp. The
binding primitive is the **clock value** (`Pose.t`), found by bracketing the frame
time between two consecutive poses — a value match, so it is immune to the
index-drift that a positional `poses[i]` join would suffer when the telemetry and
video frame counts differ (a missing pose just widens the bracket; it never shifts
which poses a later frame binds to). `Pose.seq` is a debug cross-check, not the key.

Honesty rules (DESIGN.md "never a false-precision pin"):
- A None endpoint (attitude or position) propagates to None — never 0 / level / north.
- Out-of-range frames clamp to the nearest pose but are flagged EXTRAPOLATED (no
  invented motion past the data).
- A bracket wider than `max_gap_s` is flagged STALE (interpolating across a hole lies).
- No telemetry at all -> `pose=None`, status MISSING (never a silent default pose).

The `clock_offset` + `jitter_fn` knobs perturb the pose clock before matching — the
same time-sync-offset the Monte Carlo samples (DESIGN.md §3.1). An offset of
`k*dt + eps` shifts the chosen bracket by `k` poses (the time-sync-error test).
