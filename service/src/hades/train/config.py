"""The fine-tune training config (Tasks 2.5.2 + 2.5.3).

One frozen config object, shared byte-identically by both ablation arms — so the ONLY thing
that differs between `{HERIDAL+SARD}` and `{VisDrone-pretrain → HERIDAL+SARD}` is the
pretrain `weights`. Everything that could otherwise confound the A/B (seed, determinism,
a fixed batch instead of non-deterministic AutoBatch, image size, epochs) is pinned here.

**Augmentation (Task 2.5.2) is Ultralytics built-ins, not a custom transform.** A hand-rolled
transform would fight the stochastic mosaic/mixup pipeline and the plan's
"deterministic-under-seed" requirement is a category error inside it. The one augmentation
knob this config controls is **scale-jitter (`scale`)**, which flows into
`YOLO.train(**cfg.to_ultralytics())`. Motion-blur is applied by Ultralytics' own
Albumentations integration with a small default probability when albumentations is installed
— it is NOT a `train()` hyperparameter, so this config does not (and cannot) tune it; we do
not claim a blur knob that doesn't exist.
