"""Confirmation rule + world-clustering (Task 3.6).

Promotes each track's DISPLAY-PRIORITY TIER (contact → candidate → strong) from
persistence + accumulated confidence + world-location clustering. It NEVER gates
visibility: any detected track is at least a CONTACT. Promotion to STRONG is what makes a
contact eligible for the expensive Localizer (Phase 4) and, ultimately, dispatch — so a
false STRONG is the cardinal sin and the design is hardened against flicker accordingly.

Design (hardened by adversarial red-team — see the test module docstring):

- **Promotion driver = a leaky-integrator decay score**, not a raw N-of-M count. Every
  frame `score *= decay`; on a hit `score += conf`. Sparse/periodic flicker engineered to
  hit exactly N-of-M is starved by the decay between bursts (the resonant-aliasing attack
  a pure count cannot reject). A human-legible `hits in last M` is kept as a floor/UI
  number, not the driver.

- **Schmitt hysteresis**: promote at `θ_up`, demote only below `θ_down < θ_up`, and the
  decay coast carries a STRONG contact through a short occlusion. A demote never deletes
  the contact (recall-first applies on the way down too).

- **World-cluster corroboration counts ONE centroid vote per track** (never per-frame
  points — that is fake self-corroboration), and DROPS duplicate detector firings (two
  track IDs whose boxes co-occur with high IoU are one source, not two corroborators). Two
  *distinct, de-duplicated* tracks whose centroids fall within a range-scaled radius
  corroborate — the ego-motion-fragmented-survivor win. Only gate-PASSING points vote.

KNOWN LIMITATION (documented, not handled): this is a temporal/spatial CONSISTENCY filter,
not a semantic classifier. A reliably-detected non-person (AC unit, sun glint) produces a
stable, persistent, tight track and WILL reach STRONG — possibly more confidently than a
marginal real survivor. Mitigation is upstream (detector precision) and downstream
(mandatory operator confirmation before dispatch). STRONG means "worth a human look,"
never autonomous dispatch.
