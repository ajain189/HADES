"""Fuse - geometry-weighted multi-frame localization with an honest bias floor (Task 4.3).

The flagship estimator. Given the per-frame fusable observations of ONE stationary survivor
track, it produces a single fused ground coordinate with an HONEST 2x2 covariance. The
design is the research gate (docs/plans/p4-localization-research.md) sections 1, 2, 6:

- **Full-information weighted mean** (`Wi = Sigma_i^-1`), in the local ENU tangent plane in
  meters about a fixed mission origin. NOT a scalar `1/trace` weight: the dominant heading
  error makes each `Sigma_i` anisotropic and rotated, and the only real fusion gain on a
  heading-limited system is azimuthal diversity collapsing the cross-range axis - which a
  scalar weight discards. Full `Sigma_i^-1` also self-down-weights oblique/long-range frames
  (their `Sigma_i` is huge along down-range), so no hand-tuned cos/range factor is applied.

- **Per-frame `Sigma_i` via the linearized Jacobian of the SHARED `ray_to_ground`** (central
  finite difference, 2x7). The same single-source-of-truth function the Projector uses (D1),
  never re-implemented. The cheap Jacobian is for the WEIGHT only; the final reported tail is
  refined by Monte Carlo in `uncertainty.py` (Task 4.4).

- **THE BIAS FLOOR (the headline honesty point), via MONTE CARLO OVER FUSION.** Inverse-
  variance averaging drives the zero-mean jitter down as ~1/sqrt(N) but CANNOT touch the
  common-mode heading bias (the same wind-crab offset on every frame of one pass). A naive
  `Sigma_fuse = Lambda^-1` therefore shrinks toward zero while the estimate sits on a
  CONFIDENTLY WRONG point - the "smug filter," the worst SAR failure. The research gate (§2)
  originally specified an additive analytic floor `Sigma_report = Lambda^-1 + Sigma_bias`;
  this implementation supersedes that with the gate's own §1.2 Monte-Carlo-over-fusion (the
  linearized additive form under-covered: matched coverage 0.46 / NEES ~11, vs 0.99 / NEES ~1
  for MC). `_mc_fused_cov` resamples the inputs - drawing the heading BIAS ONCE per realization
  (the common-mode rule), jitter per frame - re-fuses each, and reports the spread of the FUSED
  estimates. Because the bias is shared across a realization's frames, it does NOT average out
  within that realization: the cloud stays wide and R95 asymptotes to a floor that grows with
  the heading lever arm (ground range), never to zero. The reported R95 is the EMPIRICAL 95th-
  percentile radius of that cloud about x_hat (the honest equal-coverage circle, §4), NOT the
  major semi-axis.

- **Aspect diversity informs the floor.** A heading bias displaces the ground point roughly
  perpendicular to the camera->target azimuth; observed from a spread of azimuths it partially
  cancels (the MC cloud tightens because the per-realization bias projects to different ground
  directions across diverse frames). A single straight pass (aspect_spread < ~70 deg) is
  flagged `heading_limited` and capped at SWEEP (never PINPOINT) no matter how tight the
  variance. v1 reports the floor and the regime; it does not ESTIMATE the bias (Schmidt-
  consider is v1.x).

- **Moving-target / model-mismatch detection** via a NIS-style residual-consistency test
  (mean squared Mahalanobis ~ 2 under a static target). High/over-threshold -> the estimate
  stays CONVERGING with the (large) empirical-scatter radius, `moving_suspected=True`. A
  single gross outlier is chi^2-rejected from the fused mean first (still visible as a
  detection - the gate owns fusion-eligibility, never visibility) so it can't fake "moving".
